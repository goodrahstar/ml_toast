## Overview

**üçû ML-ToAST** is a tool that helps users cluster multilingual search terms
captured from different time windows into semantically relevant topics. It
helps advertisers / marketers surface the topics or *themes* their audience are
interested in, and accordingly tailor their marketing activities.

Under the hood, the tool relies on Google's
[Universal Sentence Encoder Multilingual](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual/3)
model to generate word embeddings, applies a couple of widely-used clustering
algorithms - namely
[K-Means](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/compat/v1/estimator/experimental/KMeans)
and [HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (with
[UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) dimensionality reduction) -
to generate clusters, and then selects the most meaningful term(s) to represent
each cluster. Input / Output is supported via Google Sheets and Google Cloud
BigQuery.

Though the samples provided here are specific to Google Ads, the same approach
can quite seamlessly be used for any other advertising platform, or simply for
any application where clustering of short texts is the goal.

## Challenges

Advertisers spend a significant amount of time analyzing how customers are
searching for and engaging with their business, in order to understand:

* Where their existing offerings resonate most; and
* How they can tailor facets of their ads, such as landing pages and
    creatives, to match changing consumer interest.

One of the approaches advertisers rely on is analyzing search queries against
which their ads appear, categorizing these queries into meaningful themes, and
analyzing themes to generate insights.

> ***Topic clustering requires both time and expertise to execute properly, and
> may be computationally resource intensive.***

In the context of Google Ads, the
[Search Terms report](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2472708) for
a particular account lists all the search queries that have triggered the ads
defined in that account, along with performance metrics (such as clicks,
impressions, etc.). It is important to note that certain search terms that don't
have enough query activity are omitted from the report in order to maintain
Google's standards on data privacy.

> ***Google Ads: though the
> [Search Terms report](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2472708)
> can be downloaded and analyzed, it is cumbersome for advertisers to sift
> through thousands of queries - usually in multiple languages - to extract
> meaningful insights.***

Google Ads employs several different
[AI-powered search](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/unlock_the_power_of_search_2022.pdf)
optimization features, one of which is Broad Match. Whereas other keyword
matching types focus only on syntax,
[Broad Match](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12159290) applies
matching based on semantics - the meaning conveyed by a search - in addition to
syntax. BM also looks at additional signals in the account - which include
landing pages, keywords in ad groups, previous searches, and more - in order to
match more relevant traffic.

> ***Google Ads: the need to understand changing user interest is becoming ever
> more important, particularly with automated search optimization (e.g.
> [Broad Match](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12159290)) becoming
> more fundamental.***

Google Ads also provides
[search term insights](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11386930)
within its user interface (UI). Search terms that triggered ads over the past 56
days are automatically analyzed and grouped into categories and subcategories,
including performance metrics.

> ***Google Ads:
> [search term insights](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11386930) -
> though technologically more sophisticated than the methodology applied here -
> cover the past 8 weeks only, are not available beyond the UI, and cannot be
> collated across accounts.***

## Solution Overview

üçû ML-ToAST tackles the challenges mentioned above in a simple, configurable and
privacy-friendly way. Input is supported via a Google Sheets spreadsheet or
Google Cloud BigQuery table. For spreadsheet-based input, search terms from
different lookback windows can be compared (configurable) to uncover terms that
are *new / trending*, or also those that have not received enough impressions
(configurable - unset by default). For BigQuery, the input is used as-is,
therefore any filtering or lookback comparison needs to be done in BigQuery
directly. This input data represents the corpus of search terms that can be
further analyzed and categorized into semantically relevant topics.

Additional input groups pertaining to Google Ads Broad Match (BM) are extracted
and analyzed to:

* Provide more transparency into BM's performance; and
* Give advertisers more control via keyword recommendations that they could
  add to / exclude from BM.

The figure below provides an overview of the core functionality of the tool.

### Get Started

The quickest way to get started with üçû ML-ToAST is to load the `ml_toast.ipynb`
notebook in Google Colaboratory via the link below:
